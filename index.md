title: Guides to finding IIIF resources
---

This is a brief guide to finding IIIF Manifest URLs from members of the IIIF community.  These guides begin from a record page, so do not include how to search or view an individual record.

Once you have a manifest URL you can use the [How to use IIIF Resources and Viewers](https://medium.com/@IIIF_io/how-to-use-iiif-resources-and-image-viewers-bd378a68b013) guide to open it in one of the many IIIF Viewers. 

This site is a work in progress and we are working to transfer all of the institution's from the St Andrews list which was an inspiration for this site:

 * St Andrew's [IIIF Resources List](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/assets/university/library/documents/IIF%20resources.pdf)

"Copy this link" is the final step in many of the guides and this involves right-clicking and "copy link address" or similar. Alternatively left click to open the link, then copy the address in the address bar.
